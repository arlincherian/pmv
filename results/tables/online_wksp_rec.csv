Topics
"Need sample content to follow, especially on risk management. Need to break down content into slides with more explanation for new comers to PM."
"Great real life scenarios shared by Bruce, would like more sample scenarios"
Would love more examples or template projects using tools like asana or monday
Maybe have more discussions in breakout rooms about what tools are working for the audience
Overall well prepared and relevant examples but link to non-profit was unclear
Content on the slides easy to follow but would be nice to have a copy of it or PDF available
Need more time in the breakout room and for the activity as the rapport is slow in the beginning and most were unsure about how to proceed with the acitivity. Recommends better explanation of activity before breaking into rooms.
